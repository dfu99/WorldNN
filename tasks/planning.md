# Planning

## Target: NeurIPS 2026 (May 6, 2026 deadline)

**Paper draft**: `paper/draft.md`
**LaTeX**: `paper/neurips2026/main.tex`

## Active AFK goal (2026-04-23 03:07 — iter-3)

Deep research sweep COMPLETE. 4 parts across 8 tasks (T17-T24). Artifacts
at tasks/research/ (10 memos). Synthesis memo is sweep_memo_2026-04-23.md.

## Next priority

Three experiments recommended by sweep:
1. *E1 asymmetry-scaling at larger embed_dim* (RunPod, 3-4 h) — addresses
   Reviewer A "does capacity eventually win?"
2. *E5 1D multi-task sensory-capacity* (RunPod, ~2 h) — addresses
   Reviewer E task-similarity on a non-push task.
3. *E2 Outcome Alignment on obj-024 data* (CPU, <1 h) — responds to PI's
   "intent vs real" framing.

Awaiting PI direction. Paper is internally consistent as-is; these
experiments are for strengthening, not rescuing.
